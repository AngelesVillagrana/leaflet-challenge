# leaflet-challenge
This is for the homework 15 of the bootcamp.
This project is an interactive visualization of earthquake data using Leaflet and D3.js. The data is obtained from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) and displayed on a map with different colors and sizes according to the depth and magnitude of the earthquakes.

## Description

The goal of this project is to provide a visual representation of earthquake data over the past month. It uses Leaflet to create and manage the map, and D3.js to fetch and process the GeoJSON data provided by the USGS.

## Features

- Interactive map with OpenStreetMap tile layers.
- Representation of earthquakes with circular markers where color indicates depth and size indicates magnitude.
- Popup information on clicking a marker, showing details about the earthquake (location, magnitude, depth).
- Informative legend explaining the color coding used for depth.

I used resources such as the assistance of ChatGPT, especially in debugging errors.
